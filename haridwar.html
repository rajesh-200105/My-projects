      <p> One of the holiest pilgrimages in India, Haridwar, or the 'gateway to gods', is located where Ganga, the sacredest of all Indian rivers, enters the Indo-Gangetic plains. Located at the foothills of the Himalayas, Haridwar is a city of temples and ashrams and its pious ambience envelops everyone. Haridwar is one of the four holy Indian cities that host the Kumbh Mela, a pious gathering of millions of Hindu devotees every 12 years.

The Ardh Kumbh is organised here every six years. It also hosts the Kanwar mela every year during the rainy season. The 'Panch Tirth' or the five pilgrimages located within the periphery of Haridwar, are Gangadwara (Har Ki Pauri), Kushwart (Ghat), Kankhal, Bilwa Tirtha (Mansa Devi Temple) and Neel Parvat (Chandi Devi). Haridwar serves as the gateway to the Char Dham of Uttarakhand as well.
