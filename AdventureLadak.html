            Popularly known as Chadar River Trek or Zanskar trek or Ladakh Frozen River Trek - it is the only one of its kind in the whole world.
             The word “Chadar” means “blanket” and is representative of the sheet of ice cover that forms over the frozen Zanskar river in 
             the dead of winter. You will realize on the trek, that it cannot be better described. The Chadar Frozen River Trek Ladakh as it is
              known today, is a walking route connecting villages along the Zanskar River during the winter. For centuries, this frozen river-bed 
              has been used by the locals, for trade and transportation. This route is most reliable in the month of January or February when the 
              sheet of ice is most stable and thick.

            Zanskar river is a big and fast flowing river all round the year. 
            It flows through a steep canyon, for the most part, between Chilling and the Zanskar valley.
             The trek is unique, it’s in high altitude and it’s on a frozen sheet of ice. This Ladakh trek from Chilling to 
             Zanskar Valley takes more than a week. We would do most of the walking in the daylight hours, and have our own small private camp.

        <p class="detailed-view-card-description">
            Viktorianz conducts Zanskar Valley trek only once a year and at a PREMIUM level and what makes us different from others is that, 
            you are led by best in class guides, our groups are small & intimate, they are very well looked after with personal attention, 
            our hotels & tents are superior and sited at better locations, our food would be variety & freshly cooked, the trekker to porters
             ratio is the best - you basically trek only with a small day pack. We are thus more committed to your privacy, safety, personal care,
              daily comforts - and directly contribute to sustained tourism practices. Once you land in Leh, except for the lunches and dinners during your 
              Leh stay, we have everything you need for Zanskar trekking (from permits, insurances, airport transfers to equipment) all catered. Accommodation in Leh: 
              Hotel Sinnge Palace or similar.
            The road will steal the remoteness of the trek and bring hoards of local tourists to these pristine lands.
