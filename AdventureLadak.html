          <p class="detailed-view-card-description">
         Popularly known as Chadar River Trek or Zanskar trek or Ladakh Frozen River Trek - it is the only one of its kind in the whole world. The word "Chadar" means "blanket" and is representative of the sheet of ice cover that forms over the frozen Zanskar river in the dead of winter. You will realize on the trek, that it cannot be better described. The Chadar Frozen River Trek Ladakh as it is known today, is a walking route connecting villages along the Zanskar River during the winter. For centuries, this frozen river-bed has been used by the locals, for trade and transportation. This route is most reliable in the month of January or February when the sheet of ice is most stable and thick. Zanskar river is a big and fast flowing river all round the year. It flows through a steep canyon, for the most part, between Chilling and the Zanskar valley. The trek is unique, it's in high altitude and it's on a frozen sheet of ice. This Ladakh trek from Chilling to Zanskar Valley takes more than a week. We would do most of the walking in the daylight hours, and have our own small private camp.

        <p class="detailed-view-card-description">
         Viktorianz conducts Zanskar Valley trek only once a year and at a premium level. What makes us different from others is that you are led by best-in-class guides, our groups are small and intimate, and they are very well looked after with personal attention. Our hotels and tents are superior and sited at better locations. Our food is varied and freshly cooked, and the trekker to porter ratio is the best - you basically trek only with a small day pack. We are thus more committed to your privacy, safety, personal care, daily comforts, and directly contribute to sustained tourism practices. Once you land in Leh, except for the lunches and dinners during your Leh stay, we have everything you need for Zanskar trekking (from permits, insurances, airport transfers to equipment) all catered. Accommodation in Leh: Hotel Sinnge Palace or similar. The road will steal the remoteness of the trek and bring hoards of local tourists to these pristine lands.
