      <h5 class="w3-center"> About Khajuraho</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Khajuraho is a group of Hindu and Jain temples in the Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The temples are known for their erotic sculptures and nagara-style architecture. The temples were built during the Chandella dynasty, which was at its height between 950 and 1050 CE. Only about 20 of the original 85 temples have survived, and they are divided into three groups. The temples are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The temples at Khajuraho were built during the Chandella dynasty, which reached its apogee between 950 and 1050. Only about 20 temples remain; they fall into three distinct groups and belong to two different religions â€“ Hinduism and Jainism. They strike a perfect balance between architecture and sculpture. The Temple of Kandariya is decorated with a profusion of sculptures that are among the greatest masterpieces of Indian art.
